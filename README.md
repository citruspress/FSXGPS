# FSXGPS
Small program for FSX/P3D that gets data using FSUIPC (free) and broadcasts it for Foreflight/iFlightPlanner/WingX using the foreflight API (https://www.foreflight.com/support/network-gps/)

Just start the program and start FSX/P3D and it'll start broadcasting on your current network. Any iPads running Foreflight/iFlightPlanner/WingX will pick it up if they're on the same network.

Only current aircraft data is supported at the moment, that means no traffic or attitude data is sent.
